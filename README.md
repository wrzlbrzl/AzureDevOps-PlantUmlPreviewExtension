# Azure PlantUML preview

The extension adds the Preview tab for files with the plantuml extensions (.plantuml, .puml, .wsd) in the AzureDevops source editor.

UML diagram image rendering occurs on the external Plantuml server. This can be either a public server https://www.plantuml.com/, and its onpremise version https://hub.docker.com/r/plantuml/plantuml-server
